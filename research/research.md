## Research

I am most well-known and publish in the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). I serve on the editorial board of the ijCSCL and review 3 to 4 journal submissions per year. I also review paper submissions to the related ICLS and CSCL conferences. During my tenure at NMHU I found it difficult to get traction in my research area. Students had interests in areas that appeared to be quite distant from mine. This has slowly changed as I have begun to look at potential intersections between student interests in AI/ML/Data Science and my deeper experience in the Learning Sciences.

I currently serve as Principal Investigator for an NSF S-STEM Scholarship grant entitled “Inclusion of Data Science and Research in a STEM Scholarship Program,”. In addition to funding, the program is designed to help STEM majors integrate data science methods and techniques into their specific research topic of interest. One interesting study to follow here is what instructional methods and resources are best suited to quickly get non-CS majors up to speed with the necessary skills needed to adequately achieve the integration. What can be learned from this, I think, is how interdisciplinary science can be conducted in undergraduate STEM education.

#### Practice Based HCI Research Framework

My area of research is centered on the analysis of group practices in technology mediated learning environments. I employ qualitative methods to document language, speech, and representational practices that are observed to be consequential to learning. As a framework, these methods and objects of inquiry form a tight loop. Observations of practice inform the subsequent iterative design of the environment/tools from which they were observed. The drawback to this is that qualitative methods don't necessarily scale well over time. Current approaches derived from data science may be useful in allowing more scalable processing of relevant units of interaction (from logs or video records) to determine patterns or other consistent sequences of interaction that shed light on how technology environments are appropriated in learning settings.

My dissertation examined (in extreme detail!) how representational practices are formed in small group interaction within a virtual whiteboard user interface. The analysis uncovered and identified practices that were established then subsequently redeployed over an extended period time as the participants engaged with multiple different mathematical problems. The dissertation lead to further work on the study of the development of longitudinal representational practices in learning environments.

#### Language Learning Resource Analytics for Researchers

Language learning resources are increasingly becoming available in online repositories. A current study I am preparing to initiate is applying semantic analysis over twenty years of full-text articles from the [Journal of Language Learning and Technology](https://www.lltjournal.org). The agenda is to explore an ensemble approach for topic modeling using LDA, ML, and citation networks. The research is focused on determining the congruency of the model with researcher practices.
