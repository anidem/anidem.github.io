### Teaching Philosophy

My conception of teaching is motivated by two overarching goals and activities: collaborative learning and progressive development of analytic skills and methods. Establishing a collaborative culture gives students confidence where they may have little and resources where they may lack knowledge and experience. I value and expect that students will develop into competent analysts of technical content, problematic situations, and fields of inquiry relevant to the topic. Students should develop well-rounded skills for problematizing, attending to details, and extrapolating patterns and exposing deeper levels of inquiry. I value the development of a student's ability to communicate, in writing and in speech, clearly thought out ideas, interrelated organizations of concepts, and complex technical systems. A student's ability to express knowledge gained through analysis to their peers and colleagues in a collaborative culture builds on skills for growth in new work or learning environments. It gives them footing to proceed with self-confidence and self-awareness. I evaluate competence not only as the acquisition of technical knowledge but the application of information to think through new problems of increasing difficulty. 
Computer Science education can be characterized has having two layers, one abstract (E.g., system design, algorithms, architectures, information theory) and the other concrete (E.g., programming, system implementation). Drawing from my research expertise in representational practices in learning environments, I tend to rely upon "notations" for illustrating concrete topics and "inscriptions" when attempting to convey more abstract concepts and theories. Students are expected to gradually incorporate such notations and inscriptions in appropriate and relevant ways in their work and in their expression of new knowledge and problems.

My teaching methods are derived from collaboration and analytic concepts by first creating an active learning environment. The primary method I use for building an active learning environment is through the Gradual Release of Responsibility method (E.g., I do, we do, you do) (Fisher, 2008). I organize this methodology in the following phases:

1.	**Demonstration**: I illustrate a present-day concern (E.g., from current events and trends discussed in the media). With the students able to relate to the topic I then provide the framework underlying the topic of study - what is the “science” underlying the issue. This entails discussing historical motivations and key elements of the topic. I emphasize the exposition of knowledge frameworks relevant to the topic so students can begin to understand early the interconnectedness of complex systems. They develop a sense of the big picture and what motivates it and drives further inquiry. They are also introduced to relevant representations for expressing knowledge within the framework.

2.	**Involvement**: I prompt, review, pose discussion questions, guide students to focus on the elements of the framework where the teacher can both model and allow the student to "try out" similar modeling. This phase is critically dependent on an established culture of collaboration and openness to idea formation in the public space of the classroom. Prior exposure to relevant representations are leveraged as a resource for understanding frameworks introduced in Step 1. 

3.	**Application**: We apply the framework sometimes in pairs and small groups then independently. This phase is usually implemented as exercises to complete outside of class but more recently I've found it more productive in some cases to engage in group work in class.

My interaction with students is based on my best efforts to present the classroom as a safe environment for being right, for being wrong, and for simply not knowing at all. When prompted to address my active questioning, I stress that the student give their best effort to answer. In my response, I model collegial conversation by correcting and recapitulating if necessary or prompting for more details. The discourse is never punitive. My impression of students in my classroom is that they are relaxed and not overly worried with being called upon and really learn to enjoy the interaction and engagement.

My assessment among all of my courses is typically a 50/50 exam/assignment distribution. Exams are always comprehensive and there are usually 4-8 assignments per semester depending on the topic. I take a project based approach to assignments where 1 to 3 assignments are small group projects spanning a 3 to 4 week period and other individual projects that span a 1 to 2 week period. I organize a project-based approach that is closely aligned with the Scrum method. Scrum is framework for organizing teams and their activity in order to optimize for adaptive problem solving and to promote innovation. Scrum is most famously known as an Agile method for software development teams. However, its designers posit that it can be applied to any project based, team-oriented endeavor where innovation and adaptation are the primary indicators of success (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2013). Given the compatibility between CS careers and team-oriented development, I am interested in applying activity organizational theories such as Scrum to my teaching and how they translate to professional adult education settings. Note that these “agile” teaching methods remain wholly congruent with my fundamental teaching tenets that emphasize collaborative learning and analytic competence.
